# Guess-the-Number-Game-python-project
# Description:
A simple number guessing game where the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100. The player repeatedly guesses the number until it's correct. The game provides hints after each guess—whether the number is higher or lower—and tracks the number of attempts made.

# Key Concepts:

* random module
* while loop and conditional logic
* User input and feedback

# Improvement Suggestion:

* Fix the double increment of the guesses counter (it's incremented even when no valid guess is made).
* Better prompt messages and input validation would enhance user experience.
